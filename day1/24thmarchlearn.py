# but why we need python for data science?
# why arent we using other programming languages?
# how big is its community?

# in the python fundamental one we will be able to write python programs, manage programs using if/else , store data using python list
# iterate over lists using loops and list comprehension
# install and work with python 3, jupyter notebook, and ipython
# build python projects that tackel real data
# create a portfolio project

# first thing in todays lecture was comment 

# in python we write a comment using # 


# after that i learnt about print function which is used to output the result
print("Hello world!")

# once we run this file we can see the output hello world in the console.

# after print function we learnt string which is basically a series of text data either in single quote or double quote
print("hello world!")

# and 
print('Hello world')
# both gives the same result


# and to store the data we use variables and in python variables are assigned using = operator
greeting = 'hello world'
print(greeting)

# this is the example of the exponent that python program uses

# 2 to the 10th power, or 1024
print(2 ** 10)

# 8 squared, or 64
print(8 ** 2)

# 9 * 9 * 9, 9 cubed, or 729
print(9 ** 3)

# We can even perform fractional exponents
# 4 to the half power, or 2
print(4 ** 0.5)
